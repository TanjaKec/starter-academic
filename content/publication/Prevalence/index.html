abstract: The data set of the 2005 Saudi reference was used to calculate the BMI for age in children below 60 months of age. The prevalence of overweight was calculated based on the two references using the WHO cutoffs (weight for height or BMI for age above +2 standard deviation score). A lower cutoff for excess weight, BMI for age > + 1 SDS (equivalent CDC cut off for overweight) was also used. All calculations were performed using the WHO and CDC software as appropriate. Chisquare test was used to compare proportions and a p-value <0.05 was considered significant.
