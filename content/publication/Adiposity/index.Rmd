abstract: Growth measurements of 70 male and 40 female patients with AD followed through childhood and adolescence were studied retrospectively and compared with the 1990 U.K. normal values. Height, weight and body mass index (BMI) were converted to standard deviation scores (SDS). Regression analysis examined whether the mean trend was different from zero.
