Open data belongs to everyone; it empowers people to make informed decisions that are not clouded by misinformation, rumour and gossip. To be able to identify the underlying facts within data sets, it is crucial that individuals and communities possess the necessary skills. Open data is often inconsistent and limited and requires a significant amount of time to organise and structure for presentation purposes.

This is a data analysis report concerning the visualisation of the COVID-19 virus within the United Kingdom and Europe. All of the report is created with [R](https://www.r-project.org). It represents a case study as an illustration of the concepts presented at the workshop on basic R for data analysts. To learn how to use R and develop a report like this visit the [Introduction To R](https://introtor.netlify.app/) website.

# Covid-19: Open Data

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, where the initial wave of intense community transmissions was cut short by interventions.

```{r Wuhan}
# If you don't have the "leaflet" package installed yet, uncomment and run the line below
#install.packages("leaflet")
library(leaflet)
# Initialize and assign as the leaflet object
leaflet() %>%
  # add tiles to the leaflet object
  addTiles() %>%  
  # setting the centre of the map and the zoom level
  setView(lng = 114.3055, lat = 30.5928 , zoom = 10) %>%
  # add a popup marker 
  addMarkers(lng = 114.3055, lat = 30.5928, popup = "<b>Wuhan, capital of Central China’s Hubei province</b><br><a href='https://www.ft.com/content/82574e3d-1633-48ad-8afb-71ebb3fe3dee'>China and Covid-19: what went wrong in Wuhan?</a>")
```
Experience has shown that for public health intervention to be successful governmental authorities need to:

- identify the infected and provide treatment 
- locate and quarantine all those who had contact with the infected 
- sterilise environmental pathogens 
- promote the use of masks and social distancing
- release to the public the number of new infections and deaths on a daily basis through open data

The importance of hand washing, wearing a mask and social distancing as a tool to limit disease transmission is well recognised, but nonetheless ensuring social distancing especially in densely populated urban areas is still challenging. Well-educated communities are critical for an effective response and for the prevention of local outbreaks. The sharing of factual information that can be understood and trusted by the communities is vital. This will lead to a change in their behaviour to implement efficiently desired public health actions is a must. Trust and transparency are fundamental in obtaining absolute public engagement. The publishing of daily figures that can be freely analysed and scrutinised can help in engaging communities and obtaining its willing and continued support in controlling the spread of infection.

## Working with a DB in R

In big organisations data is often kept in a database and data you wish to access from it might be too large to fit into the memory of your computer. Connecting from R to a database to access the necessary data for an analysis can be very useful, as it allows you to fetch only the chunks needed for the current study. R enables you to access and query a database without having to download the data contained in it. The two most common methods of connection are:

- **Option 1)**
    * the `RODBC` package: uses slightly older code; it can be used to connect to anything that uses ODBC.
```{r RODBC, eval=FALSE}
library("RODBC")
# Connection with a server called "Walmart" and a database called "Asda":
RODBC_connection <- odbcDriverConnect('driver = {SQL Server};
                                      server = Walmart;
                                      database = Asda;
                                      trusted_connection = true') #passes your windows credentials to the server; can also specify a username `uid` and a password `pwd`
dt1 <- sqlFetch(channel = RODBC_connection, sqtable = "MyTable")
```

Using `RODBC` you can write back to database tables, choosing to append or not:
```{r RODBC_SQL, eval=FALSE}
sqlSave(channel = RODBC_connection,
        dat = dt2, 
        tablename = "MyTable_R_version",
        append = FALSE,
        safer = FALSE)
```

When you finish working using the database you should disconnect from the server.
```{r RODBC_close, eval=FALSE}
odbcClose(RODBC_connection)
```

One of the authors of this package is the famous statistician [Brian Ripley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_D._Ripley), and you can find more about the possibilities it offers by playing around with it using the guidance from [RDocumentation on RODBC v1.3-17](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/RODBC/versions/1.3-17). 

- **Option 2)** 
    * the `DBI` package: a common database interface in R; can be used with different 'back-end' drivers such as MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite, Oracle etc; to write SQL it can be used on its own:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Can write an SQL query directly using the `dbSendQuery` function
# Executes the query on the server-side only, but if you want the results back in R, you need to use `dbFetch`
SomeRecords <- dbFetch(dbSendQuery(DBI_Connection, 
                                   "SELECT CustomerName_column, City_column FROM Customers_Table")) 
```    
  You can also write back to a database using the `dbWriteTable` function.
```{r, eval =FALSE}
#Writing a new table called 'Table_created_in_R' using the R data.frame called "my_df", with `append` and `overwrite` options
dbWriteTable(DBI_Connection,"Table_created_in_R", my_df, overwrite = TRUE)
```
  We use `tbl()` to define a table as if it were part of the R work-space, and to specify as the function's arguments the connection object and the name of the table in the database.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
MyTable_Rws <- tbl(DBI_Connection, "MyTable_DB")
```
If we need to pull the data from the server into R's memory we can use the `collect()` function. 

The `DBI` package can be combined with:
  
  * the `dplyr` package: to make the `tbl`s and to work on them using `dplyr` syntax
  * the `dbplyr` package: allows translation of SQL to dplyr
  * the `odbc`package: provides the odbc drivers, but you could use the functions below with other drivers instead
    
```{r, eval=FALSE}    
    DBI_Connection <- dbConnect(odbc(), 
                                driver = "SQL Server",
                                server = Sys.getenv("SERVER"),
                                database = Sys.getenv("DATABASE")
)
```


With the wave of `tidy verse` evangelists the second option has become more popular as it allows us to convert SQL into R using the `dplyr` commands chained with the pipe (` %>% `) operator. `dplyr` can translate many different query types into SQL. We can use it to do fairly complex queries without translation in just a few lines and obtain the results even though the data is still in the database.

## Reading Data
	
[European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide) provides daily updates of newly reported cases of COVID-19 by country worldwide. The downloadable data file is updated daily and contains the latest available public data on COVID-19. Each row/entry contains the number of new cases reported per country and per day (with a lag of a day).

<https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-data-response-measures-covid-19>

<https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/cases-2019-ncov-eueea>

We will start the analysis by uploading the necessary packages and data into R. If you have not got the packages used in the following code, you will need to uncomment the first line (delete the `#` symbol) in the code below.

```{r read_ecdc_data}
#install.packages(c("dplyr", "stringr")) # install multiple packages by passing a vector of package names to the function; this function will install the requested packages, along with any of their non-optional dependencies
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(readxl)) 
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(httr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(lubridate))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(cowplot))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(scales))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(sf))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(DBI))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dbplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tmap))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tmaptools))


url2ecdc <- "https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/COVID-19-geographic-disbtribution-worldwide-2020-11-30.xlsx"

suppressMessages(GET(url2ecdc, write_disk(tf <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx"))))
covid_world <- read_excel(tf)
```

We will set up the database connection to work on `covid_world` data.
```{r}
SQLcon <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")
dbWriteTable(SQLcon, "covid", covid_world, overwrite=TRUE)
```
Let's see what tables we have in our database.
```{r}
dbListTables(SQLcon)
```
We can list the fields in a table: 
```{r}
dbListFields(SQLcon, name = "covid")
```
We can run an SQL query directly from R. To illustrate it we will run a query to obtain distinct values for the field "continentExp".
```{r}
dbFetch(dbSendQuery(SQLcon, "Select distinct continentExp from covid"))
```
Next, we will run a query to count how many entries we have for each continent
```{r}
dbFetch(
  dbSendQuery(SQLcon,
              "Select continentExp, count(*) as Count  
                 from covid
                 group by continentExp"))
```
and see how many entries there are for the UK, using a `where` clause.
```{r}
dbFetch(
  dbSendQuery(SQLcon,
               "Select continentExp, count(*) as Count  
                  from covid
                  Where countriesAndTerritories = 'United_Kingdom'
                  group by continentExp"))
```

Fortunately, for people whose SQL is rusty, and who don't feel like learning both SQL and R, we can do all of this using the `diplyr` package in R.

First we need to declare covid as a `tbl` for use with `dplyr`. We'll call it `covid_ecdc` to avoid any confusion. 
```{r}
covid_ecdc <- tbl(SQLcon, "covid")
```
This will now be treated as an R tibble, but it is still in the database!!!

It is always useful to have a quick glance at the data set structure to find out how the information it contains is structured. Knowledge of the structure is important, because it allows us later to filter out the desired information very precisely, based on criteria to limit specific dimensions, i.e. variables.
```{r}
covid_ecdc %>%
  glimpse()
```
Before we go any further and start the analysis of covid data we will replicate the above queries using the `dplyr` functions. First, to illustrate how easy it is to do the column selection with `dplyr` we'll select `countriesAndTerritories` and continentExp` from our `covid_ecdc` data.
```{r}
head(covid_ecdc %>% 
       select(countriesAndTerritories, continentExp)) # returns first six rows of the vector, i.e. tibble
```
The First query was the count of entries for each continent.
```{r}
covid_ecdc %>% 
  group_by(continentExp) %>% 
  tally()
```  
The second was to look for the number of entries for the UK.
```{r}
covid_ecdc %>%
  filter(countriesAndTerritories == "United_Kingdom") %>%
  tally()
```

If you do not have to manipulate and do the engineering work with DBs, but you need to access it to obtain data for the analysis, you might find it easier to do it all using the `dplyr`. It is intuitive and therefore easier to write. You cannot deny that `dplyr`'s version also looks neater.

Next, we'll check the total number of readings for each country and present it in a table using the `DT` package. `DT` provides an R interface to the JavaScript library [`DataTables`](https://datatables.net), which will enable us to filter through the displayed data.

```{r covid_ecdc, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
if (!require("DT")) install.packages('DT') # returns a logical value say, FALSE if the requested package is not found and TRUE if the package is loaded
tt <- covid_ecdc %>%
  group_by(countriesAndTerritories) %>%
  summarise(no_readings = n()) %>%
  arrange(no_readings)
  
mdt <- DT::datatable(data.frame(tt))
widgetframe::frameWidget(mdt)
```

## Tidying Data

We will focus our analysis on European countries and select them from our `covid_world` data, saving it all as `covid_eu` data frame object as this data needs tidying and wrangling and we do not want to limit ourselves by using only `dplyr` functions in R. 
```{r ecdc_data, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
covid_eu <- rbind(covid_world %>% filter(continentExp == "Europe"), 
                  covid_world %>% filter(countriesAndTerritories == "Turkey"))  

mdt <- DT::datatable(covid_eu)
widgetframe::frameWidget(mdt)
```
You can, however, try to pull the data from the server into R's memory and by using `dplyr` functions do the required manipulations.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
covid_eu <- covid_ecdc %>% 
  filter(continentExp == "Europe") %>% 
  collect()
  
mdt <- DT::datatable(covid_eu)
widgetframe::frameWidget(mdt)
```
The experience with COVID-19 shows that the spread of the disease can be controlled by implementing the measures of prevention as soon as an outbreak has been detected.

> To monitor the effectiveness of the measures introduced, we will focus on daily cumulative cases of COVID-19 infection that can be expressed as 
$$F(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$$

> Although $F(x)$ can show the volume of the epidemic, it does not tell us directly about the changes in the acceleration of  the spread of infection. This information can be provided by the derivatives of the $F(x)$. The first derivative $F^{’}(x)$ corresponds to the information on the number of new cases detected every day. The second derivative $F^{’’}(x)$ provides the information about the acceleration of the epidemic. $F^{’’}(x) \approx 0$ indicates the state of stagnation, while $F^{’’}(x) < 0$ indicates deceleration and of course any $F^{’’}(x) > 0$ acceleration.

We will carry on with the analysis by tidying `covid_eu` data and adding the information about those derivatives. First, we notice that there are 4 columns used to contain the date of reporting, which will allow us to remove columns 2-4 as redundant. We will only keep the `dateRep` column which requires some tidying up in respect of the format in which the dates are recorded. We will also carry out the necessary calculations for obtaining the second derivative $F^{’’}(x)$ and rename some of the variables to make them easier to display and type. 😁 All of this is very easy to carry out in R using the `tidy verse`, opinionated collection of R packages for data science. 

```{r}
# --- tidy data ---
glimpse(covid_eu)
#covid_eu <- covid_eu[, -c(2:4)] # remove redundant information
covid_eu <- covid_eu %>% 
  separate(dateRep, c("dateRep"), sep = "T") %>%
  group_by(countriesAndTerritories) %>% 
  arrange(dateRep) %>% 
  mutate(total_cases = cumsum(cases), 
         total_deaths = cumsum(deaths)) %>% 
  mutate(Diff_cases = total_cases - lag(total_cases),  # 1st derivative (same as cases)
         Rate_pc_cases = round(Diff_cases/lag(total_cases) * 100, 2)) %>% # rate of change
  mutate(second_der = Diff_cases - lag(Diff_cases)) %>% # 2nd derivative
  rename(country = countriesAndTerritories) %>% 
  rename(country_code = countryterritoryCode) %>% 
  rename(Fx14dper100K = "Cumulative_number_for_14_days_of_COVID-19_cases_per_100000") %>% 
  mutate(Fx14dper100K = round(Fx14dper100K))

covid_eu$dateRep <- as.Date(covid_eu$dateRep)
head(covid_eu) # returns first six rows of the df
```

# Writing Functions

As we would like to be able to plot this time series of the second derivatives $F^{’’}(x)$ for any country, we will create functions that will allow us to extract a country from the `covid_eu` data and to plot it as a time series. 

```{r}
# function for filltering a country from the given df
sep_country <- function(df, ccode){ 
  df_c <- df %>% 
    filter(country_code == as.character(ccode))
  return(df_c)
}

# plotting the 2nd derivative
sec_der_plot <- function(df){
  df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(second_der)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = dateRep, y = second_der)) +
    geom_line() + geom_point(col = "#00688B") +
    xlab("") + ylab("") +
    labs (title = "2nd derivative of F(x)", 
          caption = "Data from: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, vjust = 2, hjust=0.5),
          panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank())
}
```

# Data Visualisation


Once we have accessed and tidied up our data in R we can carry out the exploitative analysis using visualisation as an effective tool. 

## plotly and ggplot

We will start reporting by illustrating the time series of the daily number of new cases of infection and deaths. To make this plot more informative, we will create it as an interactive web graphic using the `plotly` library. You can explore different kinds of `plotly` graphs in R from <https://plotly.com/r/basic-charts/> or by reading the [Step-by-Step Data Visualization Guideline with Plotly in R](https://medium.com/swlh/step-by-step-data-visualization-guideline-with-plotly-in-r-fbd212640de2) blog post.

**[ecdc](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en) data updated on <span style="color:dodgerblue3">`r max(covid_eu$dateRep)`</span>**

```{r plot_no_CasesDeaths, echo = TRUE}
# Plot cases and deaths day-by-day

covid_uk <- sep_country(covid_eu, "GBR")

x <- list(title = "date reported")

fig <- plot_ly(covid_uk, x = ~  dateRep) 
fig <- fig %>% add_trace(y = ~cases, name = 'cases', type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines')
fig <- fig %>% add_trace(y = ~deaths, name = 'deaths', type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines')   
fig <- fig %>% layout(xaxis = x)
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
fig
```

<iframe seamless src="fig1.html" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>

The plots below illustrate dynamic changes based on the $F(x)$ created using the `ggplot2` package. What we would like to see is the flattening of the bars indicating the slowdown in the number of new Covid-19 cases.

```{r}
covid_uk %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = dateRep, y = total_cases)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = "#00688B") + 
  labs (title = "Cumulative number of cases F(x)", 
        caption = "Data from: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu", 
        x = "Date", y = "number of cases") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, vjust = 2, hjust=0.5),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) +
  theme(legend.position="none") 
```

We will present the same information this time using the line plot integrating interactivity, displaying the information by using the `ggplotly()` function.

```{r}
pl1 <- covid_uk %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = dateRep, y = total_cases)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point(col = "#00688B") +
  xlab("Date") + ylab("Number of Cases") +
  labs (title = "F(x)", 
        caption = "Data from: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, vjust = 2, hjust=0.5),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank())
pl1
```

The following graph presents the cumulative number of covid-19 cases using a logarithmic scale to emphasise the rate of change in a way that a linear scale does not.

```{r}
pl_log <- covid_uk %>% 
  mutate(log_total_cases = log(total_cases)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = dateRep, y = log_total_cases)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point(col = "#00688B") +
  xlab("") + ylab("") +
  labs (title = "F(x) on log scale", 
        caption = "Data from: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, vjust = 2, hjust=0.5),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) 
pl_log
```

Sometimes it might be useful to present several plots next to each other. To do this in R we apply the `plot_grid()` function from the `cowplot` package. 

```{r}
plot_grid(pl1, pl_log)
```
Next we will illustrate the cumulative number of cases for all selected European countries
```{r}
all_plot <- covid_eu %>% 
  filter(country_code %in% c("GBR", "FRA", "DEU", "ITA", "ESP", "SWE")) %>% 
  filter(dateRep > (max(dateRep) - 21)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = dateRep, y = total_cases, colour = country_code)) +
  geom_line() + 
  xlab("") + ylab("") +
  labs (title = "F(x) in the last three weeks", 
        caption = "Data from: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, vjust = 2, hjust=0.5),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_date(labels = date_format("%m-%d"),
               breaks = 'day') +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) 
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplotly(all_plot)
```

<iframe seamless src="fig2.html" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>

Again, this would be easier to compare using the log scale

```{r}
covid_eu %>% 
  filter(country_code %in% c("GBR", "FRA", "DEU", "ITA", "ESP", "SWE")) %>% 
  filter(dateRep > (max(dateRep) - 21)) %>% 
  mutate(log_total_cases = log(total_cases)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = dateRep, y = log_total_cases, colour = country_code)) +
  geom_line() + 
  xlab("") + ylab("") +
  labs (title = "logF(x) in the last three weeks", 
        caption = "Data from: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, vjust = 2, hjust=0.5),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_date(labels = date_format("%m-%d"),
               breaks = 'day') +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) 
```
The following plot enables us to observe the change in the acceleration in relation to the governmental measures.

```{r}
covid_uk %>% 
  filter(!is.na(second_der)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = dateRep, y = second_der)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point(col = "#00688B") +
  xlab("") + ylab("") +
  labs (title = "2nd derivative of F(x) for the UK", 
        caption = "Data from: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, vjust = 2, hjust=0.5),

Let us see how these figures compare with other countries in particular France and Germany.

**France: $F^{''}(x)$**
```{r}
covid_fr <- sep_country(covid_eu, "FRA") 
sec_der_plot(covid_fr)
```

**Germany: $F^{''}(x)$**
```{r}
covid_de <- sep_country(covid_eu, "DEU") 
sec_der_plot(covid_de)
```

Next, we are going to visualise a comparison between these three countries of the total number of deaths month by month.

```{r}
covid_eu %>% 
   filter(country %in% c("United_Kingdom", "Germany", "France")) %>% 
   mutate(mon = month(dateRep, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)) %>% 
   group_by(country, mon) %>% 
   summarise(no_readings = n(), tdeath = max(total_deaths)) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = mon, y = tdeath, fill = country)) +
   geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge", color = "black") +
   theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, vjust = 2, hjust=0.5)) +
   labs (title = "total number of deaths by month", 
         caption = "Data from: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en", 
         x = "month", y = "number of deaths") +
   scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired") + 
   theme(legend.position="bottom") 
```

We can make the same kind of comparisons for the total number of infections. But, before we just copy/paste and make an adjustment for `y` access, note that the order of the months does not show in the timeline of covid events. The recording of information about the spread of the pandemic started last December, which means that the bars should be in order from December to November. We are also going to flip the bars to see if it will add to its readability.

```{r}
covid_eu %>% 
   filter(country %in% c("United_Kingdom", "Germany", "France")) %>% 
   mutate(mon = month(dateRep, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)) %>% 
   mutate(mon = factor(mon, levels=c("Dec", "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov"))) %>% 
   group_by(country, mon) %>% 
   summarise(no_readings = n(), tcases = max(total_cases)) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = mon, y = tcases, fill = country)) +
   geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge", color = "black") +
   coord_flip() +
   theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, vjust = 2, hjust=0.5)) +
   labs (title = "total number of infections by month", 
         caption = "Data from: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en", 
         x = "month", y = "number of infections") +
   scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set1") + 
   theme(legend.position="bottom") 
```

We can present the total number of infections for each month. As the numbers are high we are going to "control" the way the values on the `y` access are going to appear. 

```{r}
covid_eu %>% 
   filter(country %in% c("United_Kingdom", "Germany", "France")) %>% 
   mutate(mon = month(dateRep, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)) %>% 
   mutate(mon = factor(mon, levels=c("Dec", "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov"))) %>% 
   group_by(country, mon) %>% 
   summarise(month_cases = sum(cases)) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = mon, y = month_cases, fill = country)) +
   geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge", color = "black") +
   theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, vjust = 2, hjust=0.5)) +
   scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 800000, 200000), labels = c("0", "200K", "400K", "600K", "800K")) +
   labs (title = "total number of infections each month", 
         caption = "Data from: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en", 
         x = "month", y = "number of deaths") +
   scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2") + 
   theme(legend.position="bottom") 
```

Next, we are going to present the total number of deaths for each of the months since the recording began. Note, that in the code there is a line that is currently set as a comment that allows for the values to appear as texts on the top of the bars. You can go ahead and uncomment this line by removing the hashtag symbol in front of it. 

```{r}
covid_eu %>% 
   filter(country %in% c("United_Kingdom", "Germany", "France")) %>% 
   mutate(mon = month(dateRep, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)) %>% 
   mutate(mon = factor(mon, levels=c("Dec", "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov"))) %>% 
   group_by(country, mon) %>% 
   summarise(month_deaths = sum(deaths)) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = mon, y = month_deaths, fill = country)) +
   geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge", color = "black") +
   theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, vjust = 2, hjust=0.5)) +
#   geom_text(aes(label = month_cases), size = 3, hjust = 0.5) +  
   labs (title = "total number of deaths each month", 
         caption = "Data from: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en", 
         x = "month", y = "number of cases") +
   scale_fill_brewer(palette="Accent") + 
   theme(legend.position="bottom") 
```

## Spatial Visualisation

We will create a choropleth in which we will colour the EU countries according to the most current value of cumulative numbers for 14 days of COVID-19 cases per 100000. To do this we will use the shape file onto which we will superimpose this value as a colour of the polygon, i.e. country. 

```{r}
#points to the shape file
bound <- "shapes/eu_countries_simplified.shp"

#used the st_read() function to import it
bound <- st_read(bound)

# plot the shape file
ggplot(bound) + 
  geom_sf()

covid_EU <- covid_eu %>% 
  filter(dateRep == max(dateRep))


# tidy up
# make the country names correspond to ecdc data 
bound$country <- gsub(" ", "_", bound$country)
bound <- bound %>% 
  mutate(country = fct_recode(country,
                              "Czechia" = "Czech_Republic",
                              "North_Macedonia" = "Macedonia"))

# join data from the two data frames  
my_map <- left_join(bound, covid_EU,
                    by = c("country" = "country"))

ggplot(my_map) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = Fx14dper100K)) +
  scale_fill_distiller(direction = 1, name = "Fx14per100K") +
  labs(title="Cumulative number for 14 days of COVID-19 cases per 100000", caption="Source: ecdc")
```  

```{r}
mdt <- DT::datatable(my_map)
widgetframe::frameWidget(mdt)
```

With the `tmap` package, thematic maps can be generated with great effectiveness presenting several layers of information. The syntax is similar to the one adopted in `ggplot`. Motivation and the explanation of this package has been proposed and published in the article [tmap: Thematic Maps in R](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v084i06). 

If you are interested in learning more about creating maps in R check the online version of the book [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net). [Chapter 8: The Making maps with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html) provides an easy to follow overview on using the `tmap` and other packages for creating beautiful maps in R.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_map <- my_map %>% 
  mutate(ln_deaths = log(deaths)^10)

#tmap_mode(mode =  "view")

tm_shape(my_map) +
  tm_polygons("Fx14dper100K", 
              id = "country", 
              palette = "YlGn", 
              popup.vars=c("cases", 
                           "deaths")) +
  tm_layout(title = "Covid-19 EU</b><br>data source: <a href='https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19-pandemic'>ECDC</a>",
            frame = FALSE,
            inner.margins = c(0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05)) 
```

Lastly, we should not forget to disconnect from the database. 
```
dbDisconnect(SQLcon)
```
