<p>The ever emerging Internet of Things (IoT) produces vast amounts of data that can be analysed to gain useful insights into trends. The R language is widely used by statisticians for data analysis, and the popularity of R programming has increased greatly in the recent years.</p>
<p>In this workshop we teach you to â€˜speak data using Râ€™ by taking a step by step approach, starting by explaining core programming principles of the R programming language, to importing data and employing basic wrangling techniques and the grammar of graphicsâ€™ philosophy. This will enable you to produce compelling visualisations that can ultimately illustrate useful insights from your data.</p>
<p>Through a series of demonstrations and hands on exercises you will learn some of the fundamental concepts of R and you will get to know how to use its tools in a typical data science project. We will introduce you to graphical and numerical techniques for exploring the information concealed within a dataset. After we develop an understanding of our data we will use Râ€™s reproducible approach in telling our data story by creating R-Markdown documents.</p>
<p>At the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Import data from different sources into the R environment</li>
<li>Carry out basic data pre-processing &amp; wrangling</li>
<li>Learn to distinguish the most appropriate visualisations to be used for any given data challenge</li>
<li>Build advanced visualisations: graphs and maps</li>
<li>Gain proficiency in data pre-processing, data wrangling and visualisation in R by putting acquired knowledge into application, adopting a reproducible approach through the creation of RMarkdown documents</li>
</ul>
